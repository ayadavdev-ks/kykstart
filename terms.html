        <h2>Service Process & Client Responsibilities</h2>
        <p><strong>Project Brief:</strong> To begin the Service, you must complete the project brief form provided after purchase. You are responsible for providing accurate and complete information.</p>
        <p><strong>Revisions:</strong> The Service includes one (1) round of reasonable revisions on the Market Insight Report and one (1) round of reasonable revisions on the landing page draft. All feedback must be provided in the shared Project Portal document in a timely manner to avoid project delays.</p>
        <p><strong>"Pivot & Refine" Phase:</strong> If our Market Insight Report returns a "Caution" or "Re-evaluate" recommendation, the project will enter a "Pivot & Refine" phase, which includes one (1) 45-minute strategy session to collaboratively refine your idea.

        <h2>Cancellation/Refund Policy</h2>
        <p>The fee for the "First Spark" package is a one-time, non-refundable payment. Due to the strategic and creative nature of the work, we cannot offer refunds once the Service has commenced.
